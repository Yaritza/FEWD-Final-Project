                                        <p>We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other
                                        As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p>

                                        <p>Virtue is a relative term, it can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness, sentiment—the other side of the coin, believing oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind. You can't evaluate a man by logic alone, if Spock were here, he'd say that I was an irrational, illlogical human being for going on a mission like this... Sounds like fun!<p>
